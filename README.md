# Eye Blinking Detector

The Eye Blinking Detector is a website wich detects the blinking of its users. The page is build around the OpenCV framework and changes it's content on every blink. Because of that the User can directly interact with the Website.

## Description

The detection module uses the "Real-Time Eye Blink Detection using Facial Landmarks" Paper from Soukakupova and Chech (2016). The course of action is documentated in the "Eye blink detection with OpenCV, Python and dlib" tutorial from Adrian Rosebrock (2017). The second part of this project contains a Django Webserver wich takes the detection module as "input". Based on the recogntion the Webserver changes the content of the Website. The User basically can decide when the content should change. The detection works both with external and internal webcams.
